## 🖥️ Project Overview

- Targeted at new car buyers who are unsure about which model to choose among the various options from different brands due to limited knowledge about cars.
- Aims to support complex decision-making during new car purchases by providing visual characteristics and option details for various vehicles in a 3D VR environment.

## 📌 Project Purpose

This project was initiated to address the limitations of current car purchasing experiences, which are primarily based on web viewers or 360-degree videos.

- In traditional online methods, users must explore options and get quotes separately for each brand and model. In contrast, the VR showroom allows users to check all models and options regardless of brand or type.
- In offline settings, test driving is limited by time and location. This project enables users to thoroughly experience various vehicle features without physical or time constraints.
- VR simulation offers a more intuitive way to assess satisfaction with different options, overcoming the lack of visual exploration and restricted viewpoints in 360-degree videos.
